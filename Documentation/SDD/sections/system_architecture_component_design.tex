\subsection{Component Decomposition Description}
The system has been broken down into clearly defined components, which can be tested individually. Each of these components perform a function in the entire system.

\subsection{Architectural Alternatives}
There are several other architectural alternatives to the one that was chosen for this system.

\subsection{Design Rationale}
The system design emerged from iterative design and testing during the initial stages of the project.

\subsubsection{Testing}
During this stage the system's architecture was very fragile, as different parts of the system were being explored in order to determine which components were necessary.

\subsubsection{Component Development}
In this phase, the system was divided into logical components which had specific purposes. This allowed us to work on parts of the project independently in order to maximise project efficiency.

\subsubsection{Dependency Minimisation}
This was a crucial phase of system development, where the dependencies of each of the components were minimised and centralised, so that each of the components could be revised independently.
