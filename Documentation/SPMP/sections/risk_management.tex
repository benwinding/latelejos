		\subsection{Introduction}
		This risk management plan is implemented to identify and apply mitigation strategies to potential risks of the project. 
		The types of risks that will be identified will be those that may affect the health or safety of the personnel working on the project as well as 
		any risks to the expected delivery of the project. These risks will be categorised and given an impact and probability rating.
		\subsection{Identification}
			\subsection*{Types}
			There will be 5 risk categories identified. These are categories are follows: 
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Technology
			\item People
			\item Tools
			\item Requirements
			\item Estimation
			\end{itemize}	
			\subsection*{Priority convention}	
			There will be 3 main probability and impact  descriptors
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Low- probability:10-30\% , impact: 0-1 days project delay
			\item Medium - probabilty: 30-60\%, impact: 2-4 days project delay
			\item High- probability: 60-100\%, impact: >4 days project delay 
			\end{itemize}			
			
		\subsection{Analysis  and Planning}
			\subsection*{Technology Risks}
			\textbf{Robot or parts damaged or lost}\\
			Probability: Low\\
			Impact: High\\
			Strategy: If any parts or the whole robot is damaged or lost, the importance of the lost part is assessed by the team as a group. If necessary, the team must seek to collect funds in order to buy replacement parts.\\	
	
			\textbf{Wifi cannot handle code being sent to robot}\\
			Probability: Low\\
			Impact: High\\
			Strategy: Every week robot must be tested so that it can comply to commands via a wired cconnection

			\subsection*{People Risks}
			\textbf{Team members get sick at critical times}\\
			Probability: High\\
			Impact: Medium\\
			Strategy: Ensure any sick team members are encouraged to stay home in order to avoid spreading to other members. Project manager is to ensure that task assignment has some overlap in order to ensure there is at least one person able to work on critical sections.\\
			
			\textbf{Team members leave the course}\\
			Probability: Low\\
			Impact: High\\
			Strategy: Project manager to ensure that there is overlap in task assignment and that all team members have some expereience in every aspect of code.

			\subsection*{Tools}
			\textbf{University Github server no longer supported}\\
			Probability: Low\\
			Impact: High\\
			Strategy: Each team member to ensure that the project is pulled at least once per day on their machine. In the event of Github no longer being available, alternate version control methods such as SVN may be considered.

			\subsection*{Requirements}
			\textbf{Robot or parts damaged or lost}\\
			Probability: Low\\
			Impact: High\\
			Strategy:
			\subsection*{Estimation}
